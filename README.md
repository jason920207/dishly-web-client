Created in partnership with Roger Dunn, Andy Wu, Jason Zhang and Stephen DiCicco,
fellow classmates of General Assembly Web Development Immersive 29.

This app allows users to easily like or dislike photos of food dishes on their
phone to help them decide what they want to eat, where, when, and with who.

For restaurants, they are able to market their food to the community via
take-out, delivery or eat-in options while also maintaining a regular following
using a better loyalty rewards system via photos.
